## Steam IDs vs App IDs

- **Steam ID (SteamID)**: 64-bit user account ID (e.g., 76561198000000000)
- **App ID (AppID)**: Game identifier on Steam store (e.g., 730 for CS2)

Use `resolve_vanity_url` to convert a custom profile URL to a Steam ID.

## Rate Limiting

The server implements rate limiting to respect Steam API limits:
- 100 requests per minute
- Automatic exponential backoff on errors
- Proper error handling for rate limit responses
